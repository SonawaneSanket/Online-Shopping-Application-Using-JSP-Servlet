Hey everyone!!
<br>
before 6 months i was a typical mechanical student with typical mechanical brain
who don't know what coding is.
but day after day building platform with the help of firstbit solutions who actually works for their students,
the unique teaching level of vinayak sir,the hardwork of mam which works for us like knife on the butter.
vinayak sir is not only technical mentor but also real life guide who always motivates us when we are down,
Gives different level of confidence for facing any problems.
So after 6 months i was so confident in technical field as well as in life.
